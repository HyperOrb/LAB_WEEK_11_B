1. Code handling path storage based on URI: 

Answer:

Kotlin

val file = File(
    context.getExternalFilesDir(fileHelper.getPicturesFolder()),
    name
)
// AND
val file = File(
    context.getExternalFilesDir(fileHelper.getVideosFolder()),
    name
)

(Found in ProviderFileManager.kt, functions generatePhotoUri and generateVideoUri ).


2. FileInfo Attributes: 

Answer:


URI: Refers to the temporary URI generated by FileProvider to grant access to the file (captured by camera) .



relativePath: Refers to the folder location in the device's shared storage (e.g., DCIM/Pictures or Movies) where the file will be organized in MediaStore.


3. Chronological Order (Photo Capture): 

Answer:

User clicks "Photo" button in MainActivity.

checkStoragePermission checks for write permissions.

openImageCapture is called.

ProviderFileManager.generatePhotoUri creates a temporary file and URI using FileProvider.

takePictureLauncher.launch(uri) opens the Camera app.

User takes photo; Camera saves it to the URI.

onActivityResult triggers providerFileManager.insertImageToStore.

insertToStore reads the file from the temporary URI and uses ContentResolver to insert it into MediaStore (making it accessible in the Gallery).
